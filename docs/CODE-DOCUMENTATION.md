## Code Documentation
It is good practice to document your code.  Documenting includes describing what code does, why it was written the way it was, any assumptions that were made, etc.  It is no only useful to aid in collaboration, but also to help the code owner to refresh their memory when revisiting code after a long time.

### Javadoc
API Documentation is most useful to allow others to re-use code that you've written.  We are using the standard [Javadoc](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html) documentation convention.
