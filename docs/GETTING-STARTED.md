## Getting Started
### What you need to get started
   * Windows PC w/ WiFi Capabilities
   * Romi, Camera HW, Batteries, Charger, etc.
   * you have setup/installed wpilib, vscode, etc..

For this example, it is assumed you have a Romi assembled and imaged according to [Getting Started With Romi](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/index.html#getting-started-with-romi) and are connecting directly to the robot's WIFI and accessing the robot using the default IP address: `10.0.0.2`

### Base RomiReference Example Code
We use the WPILib standard [RomiReference example](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/programming-romi.html "Programming Romi") as our starting point for development.

If all is successful, *without any code modifications*, you should be able to simulate the Romi robot and drive it around using a [joystick](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/joystick.html#joystick-class).
