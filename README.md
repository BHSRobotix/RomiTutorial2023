# Romi Advanced Tutorial w/ WPILib
This tutorial provides step by step instructions on how to do WPILib based programming of the [Romi Robot Kit](https://www.pololu.com/product/4022).  It covers topics including AdvantageKit integration, running SysId, adding Odometry/Kinematics, leveraging Pathplanner, and using PhotonVision.  Once completed, you should have a Romi setup that can be used to experiment and test code that could run on an actual FRC Robot.
